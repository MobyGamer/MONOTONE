MONOTONE
========
A multi-voice tracker for the PC speaker.

For those unfamiliar with trackers, a tracker is
a song editor/player that lets you compose a song by entering notes and
effects into a "pattern" made up of rows and columns.  (Each column is
called a "track", hence the name.)  Patterns are then strung together by
an "order list" to make a complete song.

While several PC trackers already exist, MONOTONE was designed from the
ground up as a tracker for extremely simple sound devices (ie.
significantly less capabilities than Adlib/Sound Blaster cards or MIDI)
and platforms (ie. very old PCs, microcontrollers, etc.).  Until
MONOTONE, such devices have had no representation on the PC.
